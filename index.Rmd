## Hello! My name is Taylor. 
I love going to concerts, reading contemporary and literary fiction, running, and trying new restaurants with my family and friends.


## Things I Believe

Being able to sit down and read a novel is one of the best things someone can do. I think it says a lot about a person.

I aspire to see Frank Ocean in concert. One of the best artists of our generation.

The ocean or any large body of water makes me immensely happy.

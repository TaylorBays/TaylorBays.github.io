# Summary

I am currently a Master's of Science in Epidemiology student here at the Mailman School of Public Health. I recently graduated from the University of Detroit Mercy with a B.S in Biology, a minor in Womenâ€™s and Gender Studies. I have four years of undergraduate research experience and I am passionate about finding a way to lower the the maternal mortality crisis Black women are facing.

In my role as an undergraduate student researcher, I was required to do an extensive amount of literature review on current studies in the prenatal field, while also recruiting women to participate in the Biosocial Impact on Black Births 
(BIBB) study. While employed, I conducted data analysis with SPSS and wrote a research paper for the ReBUILDetroit program, where I was then able to present my findings in Honolulu, Hawaii at the National Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans (SACNAS) Conference in 2019.
